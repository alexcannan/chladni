# Notes

## Traditional Approach

Chladni figures are traditionally generated from pulling a bow across the edge of a metal plate. The vibrations that action causes combine to create a standing wave pattern, bouncing sand around until it tends towards areas of destructive interference.

What frequencies are generated from dragging the bow?

There are obvious ones, like the resonance from the bow location to perpendicularly across the square plate (plus the associated overtones). But this is only a part of it, since moving the bow along the edge can significantly change the sound and pattern.

## Simplified Approach

A simpler approach to model may be the plate being driven by a mechnical oscillator mounted in the center of the plate.
